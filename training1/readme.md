This repo contains the serial code to image ranking as described in “OHSU @ MediaEval: Adapting Textual Techniques to Multimedia Search” , S. Dudy, S. Bedrick, MediaEval Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation (IEEE satellite event), Wurzen, 2015. The idea is to iteratively score documents in a query given the already chosen documents. The code has mainly two parts learning and prediction. If you need the parallel version of the code you are welcome to write me an email or if you have any other question.

I hope you will enjoy using it,
Shiran
