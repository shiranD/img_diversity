\begin{abstract}
These working notes will describe the motivation, process, results and 
analysis of results that the we have worked on as part of the 
MediaEval task of 'The 2015 Retrieving Diverse Social Images Task'. 
The concept of our approach was in implementing a technique \cite{fscore} borrowed from documents retrieval field 
and applying it to the image domain with appropriate adjustments. 
The core idea here was that the decision making process, to produce the ranked image sequence, 
was done iteratively. Determining how different and relevant an image in 
the stack is relatively to the already chosen images.

\section{Introduction}
Imagine you are in Munich and it's just about time that everybody around you talks about going to 
Oktoberfest. Being unfamiliar with this festival you are about to search for it to understand better if 
you'd like this event and what to expect. The task of this year's MediaEval 2015 was to provide the most
diverse and relevant images to describe a place or an event in a spesific place given a query like Oktoberfest.
The organizers provided us with a fully detailed task description alnog with data set for development and test 
found in \cite{mediaEval2015}.


\section{Related Work}
%To try answering this question the task 
%orginizers provided data along with task description that are found in \cite{mediaEval2015}
The task of ordering images in a search engine given a query is
still a developing field.  The focus of this
task is on retrieving diverse and relevant images from a given set of images.
The motivation to our approach was based on a recent paper \cite{fscore} that 
described an iterative scoring method for both relevance and diversity of 
a textual document. Every document was scored against the documents that were already 
chosen. The scoring function is described in Eq.~\ref{eq:process}:
\begin{equation}
f_{s}(x_{i},R_{i})=w_{r}^{T}\mathbf{x_{i}+}w_{d}^{T}h_{s}(R_{i}),\forall x_{i}\in X\backslash S\label{eq:process}
\end{equation}
The scoring function combines information on relevance and diversity given the candidate document $x_{i}$ and its
diversity matrix $R_{i}$. 
While the prediction part above scores and chooses images the training part's purpose is
to produce the relevance and diversity weight vectors $w_{r}$, $w_{d}$ that are used in Eq.~\ref{eq:process}.
%The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference.
%ACM seeks to give these conference by-products a uniform,
%high-quality appearance.  To do this, ACM has some rigid
%requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
%is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
%set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
%certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
%a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
%the page, specified size of margins (1.9 cm [0.75"]) top, (2.54 cm [1"]) bottom
%and (1.9 cm [.75"]) left and right; specified column width
%(8.45 cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.83 cm [.33"]).



\section{The Method}
Our task's objective is to utilize the scoring concept for images while incorporating the necessary tools to determine an image scoring function. In our task 
the relevence feature vector $\mathbf{x_{i}}$ was composed of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) \cite{lsa} of 'tags' and 'description' textual fields, 
information on the user's credibility of 'visualScore', 1-'faceproportion', 'tagSpecificity', 'uniqueTags', 1-'locationSimilarity', and 1-'bulkProportion', 
and the normalized numerical data of image features.
The diversity feature vector $h_{s}(R_{i})$ was composed of the following features with their coresponding distance metrics: 
'tags' and 'description' textual fields with cosinedisimilarity, this fields were used with Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) \cite{lda} for topic diversity, 'csd' with l2 distance \cite{csd}, 'hog' with Batacharia distance \cite{hog}, 'cn' with
euclidian distance \cite{cn}, 'cm' with Canberra distance \cite{cm}, 'lbp' with Chisquare distance \cite{glbp}, 'glr' with l1 distance \cite{glr}, 
and 'cnn' with Mahalanobis distance \cite{cnn}. A feature represent a more relevant or diverse as higher its value gets.
The three algorithms described in \cite{fscore} were reduced to two algorithms since queries were provided with ranked lists 
of relevance.


\subsection{Settings}
Settings that remained similar across experiments were:
in relevance feature vector: user credibility information, lsa on 'tag' an 'description', and in diversity feature vector:
lda on 'tag' an 'description', 'hog' and 'csd'.
We implemented four different settings:
\newline 1) f1 - is using the global image features (without 'cnn')
\newline 2) f2 - is using the local image features (without 'cnn')
\newline 3) f1r f2d cnn - is using the global image features for relevance, local for diversity and global 'cnn'
\newline 4) f2 cnn2 - is using the local image features with local 'cnn'


\section{Results}
Apart from reporting the official results we would first like to show the development set results of 
two experiments: f1 and f2. These were computed seperately to the official results. We divided devset to 10-1 train test ratio
and trained. Both f1 and f2 were trained and tested on same sets which were exclusice. 
Table~\ref{tab:dev} has the results of both experiments:
